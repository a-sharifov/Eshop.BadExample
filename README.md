# Project: Eshop.BadExample

## Introduction

Welcome to the project repository Eshop.BadExample, dedicated to exploring common pitfalls in software architecture. In this project, we delve into the consequences of neglecting key design principles like CQRS, N-tier architecture, DDD, and the KISS principle.

## Overview

Eshop.BadExample serves as a case study of a project that lacks the incorporation of essential design patterns and principles. Despite its initial promise, the absence of CQRS, N-tier architecture, DDD, and adherence to KISS has rendered the project difficult to extend and maintain.

## Issues Highlighted

### Lack of CQRS
The absence of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) has led to tangled logic and inefficiencies in handling commands and queries within the system.

### Missing N-tier Architecture
The absence of a clear N-tier architecture has resulted in a lack of separation of concerns, making the system rigid and difficult to scale.

### Neglecting DDD Principles
The disregard for Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles has led to a domain model that is tightly coupled with the implementation details, hindering adaptability and flexibility.

### Ignoring the KISS Principle
The failure to adhere to the Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle has resulted in unnecessarily complex code and system architecture, making it challenging to comprehend and modify.


## Conclusion

While Eshop.BadExample may demonstrate some merit, its shortcomings highlight the importance of incorporating essential design patterns and principles from the outset. By learning from these mistakes, we aim to improve our future architectural decisions and build systems that are scalable, maintainable, and adaptable.
